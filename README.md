# NJIT Fall 2024 CS634: Data Mining Final Project

## Joshua Kobuskie

This project contains 3 main files:

The project itself (kobuskie_joshua_finalproject.py)
The Jupyter notebook that contains the project and more visual output (kobuskie_joshua_finalproject.ipynb)
A detailed report that captures the findings of the project (kobuskie_joshua_finalproject_report.pdf)

Please install python 3.12.2 or higher and the latest version of keras, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit_learn, and seaborn prior to running this program. The minimum version requirements are included in the requirements.txt document.  

It is recommended that the Jupyter notebook be utilized for reviewing the tables of performance metrics. While the output produced by the program is correct, it can be hard to interpret from the command line. Alternatively, adjusting your zoom size on the command line enables the table to fit the content and formatting properly.
